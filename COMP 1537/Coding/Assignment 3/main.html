          <p class="article_title title_text">Must Change Settings When Starting</p>
          <p class="article_text">Here we go over some of the most needed changes to the settings. Most importantly is the camera settings. The default for this is horrendous and changing it will improve your experience 10 fold. Next up is changing the graphics settings in order to achieve max frames per second so that we can have the fastest response time possible. This allows us to make plays faster and be ahead of the oponent at all times.</p>

          <p class="article_title title_text">Customization Tips</p>
          <p class="article_text">There are some crucial things to remember when customizing your car. First of all if you want to do better you don't use the topper or antenna item slots. There is no other reason for this other than being a sweat. After this we want to make sure to only use the darkest versions of each colour. Along with this we want to use the most minimal, non animated decal that we own. This way your car actually rotates faster and is easier to control. Allowing you to unlock your full potential of being a sweaty player.</p>

We are here to help people of all ranks, so even if you're bronze, you can be sure to find something for you. The very first and simplest tip we have is to always practice.
